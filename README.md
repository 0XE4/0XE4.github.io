# 0XE4

Welcome to my Github page. I'll one day learn what to write as an introduction.

##### Projects
[![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0XE4/0XE4.github.io/master/images/EmporiumTitle.png)](http://startpages.github.io/ "Startpage Emporium")
<br />Startpage Emporium is a collection of Startpages for your browser.
The vast majority of them are made for desktop screen sizes but some are also built for mobile usage.
<br /><br />
The startpages have been collected from various sources over time, with most coming from Github, Deviantart or 4chan's /wg/ and /g/ boards.<br /><br />

<br />randsecam is a simple page that uses javascript to generate a url linking you to a random page on Insecam.
Annoyingly new pages are added every hour, so I update the script when I can.
